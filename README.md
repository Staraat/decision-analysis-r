# Decision Analysis in R

This project demonstrates how to model and solve a decision tree problem using R.

## Description

The script uses `data.tree` and `yaml` libraries to:

- Load a decision tree structure from a YAML file
- Calculate expected payoffs using recursive functions
- Identify optimal decisions at each decision node
- Visualize the decision tree with labeled nodes and branches

## Tools Used

- R
- Libraries: `data.tree`, `yaml`

## Files

- `Decision_Analysis.R` — Main R script for modeling and plotting
- `plantation.yaml` — Input file defining the decision tree structure

## Output

The code generates a decision tree diagram with computed payoffs and optimal paths.

## Learning Outcome

- Expected value computation
- Tree traversal and recursion
- Decision modeling and visualization in R
